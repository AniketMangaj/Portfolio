            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Aniket Mangaj </span>
            from <span className="purple">Karnataka, India.</span>
            <br />
            I am a passionate **Java Developer** with a strong foundation in full-stack web development using React and Spring Boot.
            <br />
            I completed my BE in Computer Science and Engineering from Hirasugar Institute of Technology, Nidasoshi.
            <br />
            As a fresher, I have built several projects, including a food delivery system using JDBC, Servlets, and MySQL
            <br />
            Currently, Iâ€™m exploring opportunities to contribute to innovative Java/Spring Boot applications and grow my expertise in cloud-native architectures.
            <br /><br />
            Apart from coding, I love solving logical puzzles, exploring AI productivity tools, and staying active with outdoor sports!
